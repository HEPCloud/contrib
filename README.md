# HEPCloud's Contrib repository

This repository collects software and documentation that is not yet part of the Decision Engine framework or channels.

Please create your subdirectory with your project and add everything underneath that.
A recommended structure is to have src and doc subdirectories within each project, containing
respectively the code and the documentation (possibly in ReStructured Text or MarkDown formats). 
A README.md file, setup other auxiliary scripts can be in the root directory of the project. 
The root directory includes the Fermilab BSD-style license, LICENSE.txt. Projects may add a 
different license in their subdirectory.
One line added to the following list will help identify your project.

Projects:
* _example\_ : example project
